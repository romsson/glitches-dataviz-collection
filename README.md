# glitches-dataviz-collection

This repository contains a [collection of dataviz glitches](https://romsson.github.io/glitches-dataviz-collection/table.html) scraped from two sources:

* [accidental aRt](http://accidental-art.tumblr.com/) on Tumblr
* [#d3brokenandmadeart](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=d3brokenandmadeart) on Twitter

If you are interested in glitches (in general, not just dataviz), I recommend the following article:

* [The long, twisted history of glitch art](http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/issue-sections/features-issue-sections/12265/glitch-art-history/), by Miles Klee.
